# Confetti Invite – GitHub Pages Starter

A tiny React + Vite site that shows a letter icon which explodes into confetti and reveals a message with a **Navigate** button to open maps for: `12721 S Dixie Hwy, Pinecrest, FL 33156, United States`.

## Local dev
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. **Create a GitHub repo** (any name works) and copy the repo name.
2. The Vite config now emits relative asset URLs for production builds, so no additional configuration is required for GitHub Pages. If you build in another CI system that needs an absolute path, pass `--base=/your/custom/base/` to `npm run build`.
3. Commit & push all files to the **main** branch:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial commit (Generated by Soopy <3)"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. In GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages** → set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (it may already be auto-detected by the workflow).
5. The `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow will build and publish `/dist`. After it finishes, your site is live at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- If the page shows a blank screen or 404 on refresh, open the deployed page’s **View Source** and confirm asset URLs start with `./assets/`. Re-run `npm run build` if they do not—the relative base path ensures GitHub Pages always serves the correct bundle.
- If Tailwind styles don’t load, ensure `src/index.css` is imported in `src/main.tsx` and that the `content` globs in `tailwind.config.js` include your `src/**/*.tsx` files.
- If GitHub Actions reports that the lockfile is missing, run `npm install` locally once to generate a real `package-lock.json` and commit it. The workflow uses `npm install --no-audit --no-fund`, so a generated lockfile will be respected but isn't strictly required for successful builds.
- If the **Navigate** button doesn’t open the native maps app on mobile, your device/browser may block the scheme. It will always fall back to Google Maps in a new tab on desktop.
